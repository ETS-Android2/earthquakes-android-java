        shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the
        Earth\'s lithosphere &lt;i>(the rigid outer part of the earth)&lt;/i> that creates seismic waves.
        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt
        to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities.

    <string name="activity_glossary_epicenter_definition">
        In seismology, the &lt;b>epicenter&lt;/b> is the point on the Earth\'s surface directly above a

        A &lt;b>fault&lt;/b> is a crack in the Earth\'s crust. Typically, faults are associated with, or
        form, the boundaries between Earth\'s tectonic plates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an active fault, the
        pieces of the Earth\'s crust along a fault move over time. The moving rocks can cause
        earthquakes.

    <string name="activity_glossary_intensity_definition">
        The &lt;b>intensity&lt;/b> is a number &lt;i>(written as a Roman numeral)&lt;/i> describing the severity
        of an earthquake in terms of its effects on the earth\'s surface and on humans and their
        structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several intensity scales exist, but one of the most commonly used is the
        Modified Mercalli scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many intensities for an earthquake, depending on where you are, unlike the
        magnitude, which is one number for each earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The estimated intensity is generated with data gathered by instruments. The reported
        intensity is generated with data given by people who reports the earthquake.

        The &lt;b>magnitude&lt;/b> is a number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake. It
        measures the energy released at the source of the earthquake and is determined from
        measurements on seismographs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several magnitude scales have been defined, but one

        The &lt;b>Modified Mercalli intensity scale&lt;/b> is a scale to measure the intensity of
        earthquakes. Unlike with the Richter scale, the Mercalli scale does not take into account
        energy of an earthquake directly. Rather, it classifies earthquakes by the effects they have
        &lt;i>(and the destruction they cause)&lt;/i>. When there is little damage, the scale describes how
        people felt the earthquake, or how many people felt it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very often, non-geologists
        use this scale, because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake
        caused, than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Values range
        from &lt;i>I - Instrumental&lt;/i> to &lt;i>XII - Catastrophic&lt;/i>.

    <string name="activity_glossary_richter_definition">
        The &lt;b>Richter magnitude scale&lt;/b> is a scale of numbers used to tell the power
        (or magnitude) of earthquakes. &lt;i>Charles Richter&lt;/i> developed the Richter Scale in 1935. His
        scale worked like a seismogram, measured by a particular type of seismometer at a distance
        of 100 kilometers (62 mi) from the earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthquakes 4.5 or higher on the
        Richter scale can be measured all over the world. An earthquake a size that scores 3.0 is
        about 10 times the amplitude of one that scores 2.0. The energy that is released increases
        by a factor of about 32.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every increase of 1 on the Richter scale corresponds to
        an increase in amplitude by a factor of 10; therefore, it is a logarithmic scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        The earthquake with the biggest recorded magnitude was the &lt;i>Great Chilean Earthquake&lt;i>.
        It had a magnitude of 9.5 on the Richter scale and occurred in 1960. Around 6,000 people
        died because of the earthquake. No earthquake has ever hit 10+ on the Richter Scale.
